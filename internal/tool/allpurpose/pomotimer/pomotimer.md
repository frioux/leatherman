Run starts a timer for 25m or the duration expressed in the first
argument.

```
pomotimer 2.5m
```

or

```
pomotimer 3m12s
```

Originally a timer for use with [the pomodoro][1] [technique][2].  Handy timer in any case
since you can pass it arbitrary durations, pause it, reset it, and see it's
progress.
